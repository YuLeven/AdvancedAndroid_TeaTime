# TeaTime

This is the toy app for the Espresso lesson of the [Advanced Android App Development course on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/advanced-android-app-development--ud855).

TeaTime is a mock tea ordering app that demonstrates various uses of the Espresso Testing framework (i.e. Views, AdapterViews, Intents, IdlingResources).

This is my own implementation (it's present on the master branch). The instructor's version can be found on the Solution branches.
